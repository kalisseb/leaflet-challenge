Using earthquake data from USGS, I created a map of significant earthquakes within the last 7 days. 

Each datapoint is mapped by magnitude and depth. The map has been centered on Northern and Central America but global data is available. Selecting a marker will display the location and time of the earthquake along with magnitude and depth.
